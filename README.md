# Concept:

It’s not my intent to provide details on every tool here, rather to jog your memory as to what the tool’s name was so you can do a quick online search to find more.

Style convention for these notes:
- Any example that's more than a few lines should get it's own markdown page. Use link syntax: `[text to link](relative/path/to/markdown.md)`
- Use code blocks (enclosed by backticks `` ` ``) to mark code and keywords, for example, `PATH`

# All available notes:
Programming environment:
* [Shell and command line tips](bash.md)
* [Module](module.md)
