# Concept:

These are notes from a series of internal meetings, "QMC Meeting" taking place in summer of 2021 at the Flatiron Institute's CCQ. 

It’s not my intent to provide details on every tool here, rather to jog your memory as to what the tool’s name was so you can do a quick online search to find more.

Style convention for these notes:
- Any example that's more than a few lines should get it's own markdown page. Use link syntax: `[text to link](relative/path/to/markdown.md)`
- Use code blocks (enclosed by backticks `` ` ``) to mark code and keywords, for example, `PATH`
