# Research tools notes
Notes on tools used for programming and research compiled from QMC Meetings at the CCQ in August of 2021. 

It’s not my intent to provide details on every tool here, rather to jog your memory as to what the tool’s name was so you can do a quick online search to find more.

The [Wiki page](https://github.com/bbusemeyer/research_tools/wiki) at linked at the top of the Github contains most of the information.
