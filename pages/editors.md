# Editors and Integrated Development Enviornments (IDEs)

There are many tools for editting code. The *right* one to use mostly comes
down to personal preference and what works for you. This is a quick list of 
editors that are known to "work" with some pros/cons.

Sometimes, IDEs get in the way by overcomplicating simple tasks (especially older ones).
Text editors can be a great choice for simple editting, or more complex editting in a few 
cases. 

## vim (text editor)

Pros:
- installed by default in most linux distributions
- very powerful and flexible
- can start with simple commands, and build up to complex commands over time
- syntax highlighting for code

Cons:
- still a bit of a learning curve
- text-based

Good for:
- general purpose text editting 
- code development

## emacs (text editor)

Pros:
- (similar to vim) very powerful and flexible
- can start with simple commands, and build up to complex commands over time
- extensible (only a pro if you use it)
- syntax highlighting for code

Cons:
- still a bit of a learning curve
- not installed by default, but readily available on Linux, MacOSX
- text-based

Good for:
- general purpose text editting 
- code development

## Sublime Text (text editor)

Pros:
- Many useful features
- GUI-based
- syntax highlighting for code

Cons:
- not "free", although it can be evaluated for free with no expiration date

Good for:
- general purpose text editting
- code development
- editting outside of a command line


## Visual Studio Code (text editor)

Pros:
- Cross-platform
- light-weight (for an IDE)
- free
- plugins available for essentially all major programming languages
- integrates directly with git
- clean, intuitive GUI

Cons:
- can require some setup

Good for:
- code development, especially larger projects
