# Plotting and analyzing data

## Handling data.

### Python + Pandas.

Useful applications:
- pretty printing of data, including in Jupyter or on the cluster.
- Group-apply-combine operations, e.g. averaging, normalizing, shifting subsets of data.
- Cleaning up and merging data.
- Plotting data, interfaces with `matplotlib` very well.

### R

I used this many years ago, and it basically has the same properties as Pandas, but is function-oriented. `ggplot` is amazing for plotting.
